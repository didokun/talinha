          <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
          <p>November 8, 2026 · Talinha Studio</p>
          <p>This policy covers Tidiva for iPhone and the Talinha Studio website. Contact <a href="mailto:support@talinha.com">support@talinha.com</a> with privacy questions or requests.</p>
          <h2>Your home and profile</h2>
          <p>Tidiva stores your rooms, floors, tasks, routines, work schedule, reminder settings and activity history locally on your device. Optional profile fields include your name and age. If you choose Sign in with Apple, Apple may provide your name, an email address or relay address, and an account identifier. Tidiva saves the shared profile information locally. Device backups depend on your Apple settings.</p>
          <h2>Calendar, reminders and exports</h2>
          <p>Reminders are scheduled on your device with your permission. When you request calendar sync, Tidiva asks for calendar access to create, update or remove its events. Event titles, dates, rooms, durations and task notes go to the selected calendar account, which can sync them to its provider. Remove Tidiva events in the app before resetting it. A CSV export goes to the destination you choose.</p>
          <h2>Purchases and advertising</h2>
          <p>Apple handles payment and subscription management. Tidiva checks verified purchase information to unlock Premium. In the free version, Google AdMob may process IP addresses, device identifiers, app interactions and diagnostic information to deliver and measure ads and prevent fraud. Data processed depends on consent, settings and the ad served. Tidiva does not supply your task text or profile details in ad requests. The entered age is used locally to determine ad eligibility. Where available, review Advertising privacy choices in the app’s settings.</p>

          <h2>Website and support</h2>
          <p>This static site has no analytics scripts or contact form. Its hosting provider may process IP addresses and request metadata to deliver pages and protect the service. If you email us, we receive your address and the contents you send. We use that correspondence to respond and keep it as needed to resolve the request and meet applicable obligations.</p>
          <h2>Your choices</h2>
          <p>Change permissions in iPhone Settings. Remove your local profile or reset local data in Tidiva. Exported files and calendar copies are controlled separately. Depending on where you live, you may have rights to access, correct or delete personal information, object to processing, or contact your local data protection authority. Email us for help with data held by the studio.</p>
